XOR, or exclusive OR, is a logical operation that takes two binary digits (0 or 1) and returns 1 if the number of 1s is odd, or 0 if the number of 1s is even. Here's a truth table that represents how XOR works:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
|    0    |    0    |   0    |
|    0    |    1    |   1    |
|    1    |    0    |   1    |
|    1    |    1    |   0    |

In the truth table:

- "Input A" and "Input B" represent the two binary digits you want to XOR.
- "Output" represents the result of the XOR operation on the two input values.

As you can see, XOR returns 1 when the number of 1s in the inputs is odd (e.g., 0 XOR 1 or 1 XOR 0), and it returns 0 when the number of 1s is even (e.g., 0 XOR 0 or 1 XOR 1).
